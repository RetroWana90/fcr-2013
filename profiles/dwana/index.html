				My name is D'Wana Stewart, I'm trasnferring to State in August 2013 from City College of San Francisco and need some assistance in finical aid. I attended City College for the last four years and prior to that I was attending UC Davis for a year after I graduated from June Jordan Small School for Equity in 2008. I currently have 262 units to transfer, which gives me enough units to graduate ahead of schedule.  I'm majoring in Broadcast Communications and possibly minor in Journalism, and attending Bay Area Video Coalition which is a internship which provides young adults with job opportunities and classes which will prepare them in their careers. I have also recently started teaching Digital media classes and trying to earn my degree in Spring 2014.
