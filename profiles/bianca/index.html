		<h2>Birth Control Side Effects</h2>
		<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rgeEe7i1ZE0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>
This remix was created to emphasize the potential serious side effects of birth control. 
Each commercial delivers their message differently but they all say the same exact things 
about the serious side effects. Birth control is really something to think about before 
taking and commercials make these side effects sound normal and so I made this video to 
raise awareness that birth control is more complicated than it seems to be.

"Birth Control Side Effects Remixed" was remixed by Bianca Gonzalez as a part of 
Film/Code Remix class at BAVC 2013.
