		<h3>"Girls Code"</h3>Remix By: Andrew Montoya
		 as a part of Film/Code Remix class at BAVC 2013. 
		<br />
		 This remix shows the persuasiveness of snack and fast-food advertising.
		 These advertisements show people eating in a way that depicts unhealthy eating 
		 habits without any concept of nutrition. The ads focus on gluttony and over 
		 eating as a means to sell their products. To create this remix, I searched for 
		 ads that show people eating snacks and fast food. Its my intention to make people
		 aware of these unhealthy food choices.
