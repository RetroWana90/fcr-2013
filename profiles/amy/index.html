					DESCRIPTION: This nostalgic video is for all the children of the 80s and 90s who spent their childhood in front of the TV, where 80s PSAs were mostly about crack/cocaine that ran into the 90s. Many famous celebrities talked about drugs, but were their associations with drugs in PSAs positive or negative to impressionable young children? You decide.
